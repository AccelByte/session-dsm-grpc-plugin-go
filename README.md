`AccelByte Gaming Services` (AGS) features can be customized using 
`Extend Override` apps. An `Extend Override` app is basically a `gRPC server` which 
contains one or more custom functions which can be called by AGS instead of the 
default functions.

## Overview

This repository provides a project template to create an `Extend Override` 
app for `session dsm grpc plugin server` written in `Go`. It includes an example of how the
custom functions can be implemented. It also includes the essential 
`gRPC server` authentication and authorization to ensure security. Additionally, 
it comes with built-in instrumentation for observability, ensuring that metrics, 
traces, and logs are available upon deployment.

You can clone this repository to begin developing your own `Extend Override` 
app for `session dsm grpc plugin server`. Simply modify this project by implementing
your own logic for the custom functions.

## Setup

To be able to run this app, you will need to follow these setup steps.

1. Create a docker compose `.env` file by copying the content of 
   [.env.template](.env.template) file.

   > :warning: **The host OS environment variables have higher precedence compared to `.env` file variables**: If the variables in `.env` file do not seem to take 
   effect properly, check if there are host OS environment variables with the 
   same name. See documentation about 
   [docker compose environment variables precedence](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/envvars-precedence/) 
   for more details.

2. Fill in the required environment variables in `.env` file as shown below.

   ```
   AB_BASE_URL=https://prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io      # Base URL of AccelByte Gaming Services prod environment
   AB_CLIENT_ID='xxxxxxxxxx'                                   # Client ID from the Prerequisites section
   AB_CLIENT_SECRET='xxxxxxxxxx'                               # Client Secret from the Prerequisites section
   PLUGIN_GRPC_SERVER_AUTH_ENABLED=false                       # Enable or disable access token and permission verification
   
   // AWS Gamelift Config
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='xxxxxxx'                                 # aws access key if using gamelift
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='xxxxxx'                              # aws secret key if using gamelift
   GAMELIFT_REGION='us-west-2'                                 # aws secret key if using gamelift region
   
   // GCP Config
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=xxxxx-xxxx                                   # GCP Project ID
   GCP_NETWORK=public                                          # GCP Network type
   GCP_MACHINE_TYPE=e2-micro                                   # GCP intance type
   GCP_REPOSITORY=asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/xxxx/gcpvm    # GCP Repository
   GCP_RETRY=3                                                 # GCP Retry to get instance
   GCP_WAIT_GET_IP=1                                           # GCP wait time to get the instance IP in seconds
   ```

3. Access to AccelByte Gaming Services environment.
a. Base URL: https://prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io/admin

## Building

To build this app, use the following command.
the image only can run 1 server gcpvm or gamelift

```
docker build -f Dockerfilegamelift . // this is use for gamelift
docker build -f Dockerfilegcpvm . // this is use for gcpvm
```

## Running

To (build and) run this app in a container, use the following command.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-gamelift.yaml up --build // this is for gamelift server
docker-compose -f docker-compose-gcpvm.yaml up --build // this is for gcp server
```

## Testing

### Test in Local Development Environment

The custom functions in this app can be tested locally using [postman](https://www.postman.com/).

1. Run this app by using the command below.

   ```shell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-gamelift.yaml up --build // this is for gamelift server
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-gcpvm.yaml up --build // this is for gcp server
   ```

2. Open `postman`, create a new `gRPC request`, and enter `localhost:6565` as server URL.

3. In `postman`, continue by selecting `CreateGameSession` grpc call method and click `Invoke` button, this will start stream connection to the gRPC server.

4. Still in `postman`, continue sending parameters first to specify number of players in a match by copying sample `json` below and click `Send`.

   ```json
   {
    "client_version": "test",
    "deployment": "test-deployment",
    "game_mode": "test-game",
    "maximum_player": "10",
    "namespace": "testing",
    "requested_region": [
        "us-west-1",
        "us-west-2"
    ],
    "session_data": "testing",
    "session_id": "uuidv4"
   }
   ```

### Test with AccelByte Gaming Services

For testing this app which is running locally with AGS,
the `gRPC server` needs to be exposed to the internet. To do this without requiring 
public IP, we can use something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

1. Run this app by using command below.

   ```shell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-gamelift.yaml up --build // this is for gamelift server
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-gcpvm.yaml up --build // this is for gcp server
   ```

2. Sign-in/sign-up to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and get your auth token in `ngrok` dashboard.

3. In this app root directory, run the following helper command to expose `gRPC server` port in local development environment to the internet. Take a note of the `ngrok` forwarding URL e.g. `http://0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:xxxxx`.

   ```
   make ngrok NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. In admin portal go to -> Multiplayer > Matchmaking > Session Configuration. Click on the Add Session Template button. Select the Server configuration to be a DS - Custom. Then, select the Custom URL option and provide the ngrok forwarding URL from step 3.

5. create gamesession or do matchmaking

6. in Sessions and Parties - > check in session detail base on session id -> if ds status available check your server in GCPVM or gamelift

> :warning: **Ngrok free plan has some limitations**: You may want to use paid plan if the traffic is high.

## Deploying

After done testing, you may want to deploy this app to `AccelByte Gaming Services`.

1. [Create a new Extend Override App on Admin Portal](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override-ags-feature/getting-started-with-cloudsave-validator-customization/#create-the-extend-app). Keep the `Repository URI`.

2. Download and setup [extend-helper-cli](https://github.com/AccelByte/extend-helper-cli/) (only if it has not been done previously).

3. Perform docker login with `extend-helper-cli` using the following command.

   ```
   extend-helper-cli dockerlogin --namespace <my-game> --app <my-app> --login
   ```

   > :exclamation: For your convenience, the above `extend-helper-cli` command can also be 
   copied from `Repository Authentication Command` under the corresponding app detail page.

4. Build and push app docker image to AccelByte ECR using the following command.
   
   ```
   extend-helper-cli image-upload --work-dir <my-project-dir> --namespace <my-game> -f <Dockerfilegcpvm or Dockerfilegamelift> --app <my-app> --image-tag v0.0.1
   ```

   > :warning: Make sure to perform docker login (step 3) before executing the above command.

5. Open Admin Portal, go to **Extend** -> **Overridable Features**. And then select the extend app.

6. To deploy selected image tag, click **Image Version History** and select 
   desired image tag to be deployed.

7. Click **Deploy Image**, confirm the deployment and go back to App Detail by 
   clicking **Cancel**.

8. Wait until app status is running.

## Next Step

Proceed to create your own `Extend Override` app for `session dsm grpc plugin server` by modifying this project. See [here](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override-ags-feature/session-dsm-function/) for more details.
