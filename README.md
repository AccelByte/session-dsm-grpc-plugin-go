`AccelByte Gaming Services` (AGS) features can be customized using 
`Extend Override` apps. An `Extend Override` app is basically a `gRPC server` which 
contains one or more custom functions which can be called by AGS instead of the 
default functions.

## Overview

This repository provides a project template to create an `Extend Override` 
app for `session dsm grpc plugin server` written in `Go`. It includes an example of how the
custom functions can be implemented. It also includes the essential 
`gRPC server` authentication and authorization to ensure security. Additionally, 
it comes with built-in instrumentation for observability, ensuring that metrics, 
traces, and logs are available upon deployment.

You can clone this repository to begin developing your own `Extend Override` 
app for `session dsm grpc plugin server`. Simply modify this project by implementing
your own logic for the custom functions.

## Setup

To be able to run this app, you will need to follow these setup steps.

1. Create a docker compose `.env` file by copying the content of
   [.env.template](.env.template) file.

   > :warning: **The host OS environment variables have higher precedence compared to `.env` file variables**: If the variables in `.env` file do not seem to take
   effect properly, check if there are host OS environment variables with the
   same name. See documentation about
   [docker compose environment variables precedence](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/envvars-precedence/)
   for more details.

2. Fill in the required environment variables in `.env` file as shown below.

   ```
   AB_BASE_URL=https://prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io        # Base URL of AccelByte Gaming Services prod environment
   AB_CLIENT_ID='xxxxxxxxxx'                                   # Client ID from the Prerequisites section
   AB_CLIENT_SECRET='xxxxxxxxxx'                               # Client Secret from the Prerequisites section

   DS_PROVIDER='DEMO'                                          # Select DS implementation, DEMO, GAMELIFT, or GCP
   
   // AWS Gamelift Config

   AWS_REGION='us-west-2'                                      # AWS region for gamelift
   GAMELIFT_REGION='us-west-2'                                 # alias of AWS_REGION
      
   // GCP Config
   GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE='./account.json'                   # GCP service account file in json format
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=xxxxx-xxxx                                   # GCP Project ID
   GCP_NETWORK=public                                          # GCP Network type

   GCP_WAIT_GET_IP=1                                           # GCP wait time to get the instance IP in seconds
   GCP_IMAGE_OPEN_PORT=8080                                    # Dedicated server open port
   ```

3. Access to AccelByte Gaming Services environment.

   a. Base URL: https://prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io/admin

## Running

To (build and) run this app in a container, use the following command.

```
docker compose up --build
```

## Testing

### Test in Local Development Environment

The custom functions in this app can be tested locally using [postman](https://www.postman.com/).

1. Run this app by using the command below.

   ```shell
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Open `postman`, create a new `gRPC request`, and enter `localhost:6565` as server URL.

3. In `postman`, continue by selecting `CreateGameSession` grpc call method and click `Invoke` button, this will start stream connection to the gRPC server.

4. Still in `postman`, continue sending parameters first to specify number of players in a match by copying sample `json` below and click `Send`.

   ```json
   {
    "client_version": "test",
    "deployment": "test-deployment",
    "game_mode": "test-game",
    "maximum_player": "10",
    "namespace": "testing",
    "requested_region": [
        "us-west-1",
        "us-west-2"
    ],
    "session_data": "testing",
    "session_id": "uuidv4"
   }
   ```

### Test with AccelByte Gaming Services

To test the app, which runs locally with AGS, the `gRPC server` needs to be connected to the internet. To do this without requiring public IP, you can use local tunnel service.

1. Run this app by using command below.

   ```shell
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Expose `gRPC server` TCP port 6565 in local development environment to the internet. Simplest way to do this is by using local tunnel service provider.
   - Sign in to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and get your `authtoken` from the ngrok dashboard and set it up in your local environment.
      And, to expose `gRPC server` use following command:
      ```bash
      ngrok tcp 6565
      ```

   - **Or** alternatively, you can use [pinggy](https://pinggy.io/) and use only `ssh` command line to setup simple tunnel.
      Then to expose `gRPC server` use following command:
      ```bash
      ssh -p 443 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -R0:127.0.0.1:6565 tcp@a.pinggy.io
      ```

   Please take note of the tunnel forwarding URL, e.g., `http://0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:xxxxx` or `tcp://xxxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.a.free.pinggy.link:xxxxx`.

   > :exclamation: You may also use other local tunnel service and different method to expose the gRPC server port (TCP) to the internet.

3. In admin portal go to -> Multiplayer > Matchmaking > Session Configuration. Click on the Add Session Template button. Select the Server configuration to be a DS - Custom. Then, select the Custom URL option and provide the tunnel forwarding URL from step 2.

4. create gamesession or do matchmaking

5. in Sessions and Parties - > check in session detail base on session id -> if ds status available check your server in GCPVM or gamelift

## Deploying

After completing testing, the next step is to deploy your app to `AccelByte Gaming Services`.

1. **Create an Extend Override app**

   If you do not already have one, create a new [Extend Override App](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override/session-dedicated-server/get-started-session-dedicated-server/#create-the-extend-app).

   On the **App Detail** page, take note of the following values.
   - `Namespace`
   - `App Name`

2. **Build and Push the Container Image**

   Use [extend-helper-cli](https://github.com/AccelByte/extend-helper-cli) to build and upload the container image.

   ```
   extend-helper-cli image-upload --login --namespace <namespace> --app <app-name> --image-tag v0.0.1
   ```

   > :warning: Run this command from your project directory. If you are in a different directory, add the `--work-dir <project-dir>` option to specify the correct path.

3. **Deploy the Image**
   
   On the **App Detail** page:
   - Click **Image Version History**
   - Select the image you just pushed
   - Click **Deploy Image**

## Next Step

Proceed by modifying this `Extend Override` app template to implement your own custom logic. For more details, see [here](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override/session-dedicated-server/customize-session-dedicated-server/).
