# Proto Files (Override)

The `.proto` files in this repository are provided by AccelByte and define the gRPC service contract.

- Implement the defined service methods with your custom logic.
- Do **not** modify the `.proto` definitions — they must match what AGS expects.
- Generated code (`*_grpc.pb.go`, `*_pb2.py`, etc.) is regenerated from proto and should not be hand-edited.
